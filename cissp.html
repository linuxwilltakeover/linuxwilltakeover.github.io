					<h1>Certified Information Systems Security Professional. </h1>
					<br>
					<blockquote>
					Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) is an independent information security certification
					granted by the International Information System Security Certification Consortium,
					also known as (ISC)².
					</blockquote>
					<br>
					<blockquote>
					As of 16 November 2016, there are 110,980 (ISC)² members holding the CISSP certification worldwide, in 162 countries. In June 2004, the CISSP designation was accredited under the ANSI ISO/IEC Standard 17024:2003. It is also formally approved by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in both their Information Assurance Technical (IAT) and Managerial (IAM) categories for their DoDD 8570 certification requirement. The CISSP has been adopted as a baseline for the U.S. National Security Agency's ISSEP program. CISSP is a globally recognized certification in the field of IT security.
					</blockquote>
					<br>
					<blockquote>
					While the CISSP has been criticized by sections of the security community, especially the pen-testing space (where it gets compared to ethical hacking certifications), it is worthwhile to note that the CISSP aims for a wider and more holistic coverage of information security rather than focusing only on technology security.
